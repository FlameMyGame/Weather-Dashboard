# Weather-Dashboard


## Main use
This is a weather dashboard, you can use this to search any city name and will display the temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV-index of the current day as well as displaying the predicted weather for the next four days after that, each having their own icons telling whether it will be sunny, cloudy or rainy. 

## Side notes
You can search as many cities as you'd like with no cap to how many can be stored in your local storage, that'w where the 'clear gistory' button comes handy, by clicking this button you clear your local storage of all searches.
